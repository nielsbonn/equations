# Remarks

* The files pdes.tex and n2k2.tex are here for the record. They were merged to
the main file (g-p.tex at the moment).

## Suggestions

* Set up a convention for labels (something like {l: {eq: {p: ).
* Make shorter labels.

## Todo

* Proof of item (v) of p:psr.
* Proof of easy formulae lemma (I just sketched, but it seems enough).
* Estimate for `U_t^* NK U_t`.
