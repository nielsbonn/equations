# Remarks

* The files pdes.tex and n2k2.tex are here for the record. They will
  eventually be merged to the main file (g-p.tex at the moment).
* Copied stuff to g-p.tex. Of course, there is still overlap and extra
  material, but I think it was time to move to just one file.

## Suggestions

* Set up a convention for labels (something like {l: {eq: {p: ).
* Make shorter labels.

## Todo

* Proof of item (v) in a lemma.
* Proof of easy formulae lemma.
* Estimate for `U_t^* NK U_t`.
